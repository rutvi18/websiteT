							<p>“The Most Essential Parenting Skills”
Parenting is the most challenging job out there. For the most part, you know your child better than anyone else. When in doubt go with your gut and develop a support structure to go to when you are unsure of where to go next.  
A loving parent is warm, willing to set limits and unwilling to breach a child’s psychological boundaries by invoking shame or guilt. Parents must acknowledge their own anxiety. Your job is to know your child well enough to make a good call about whether he can manage a particular situation. Will you stay up worrying? Probably, but the child’s job is to grow, yours is to control your anxiety so it doesn’t get in the way of his reasonable moves toward autonomy.
Parents also have to be clear about their own values. Children watch us closely. If you want your children to be able to stand up for their values, &nbsp you have to do the same. If you believe that a summer spent reading, taking creek walks and playing is better than a specialized camp, then stick to your guns. Parents also have to make sure their own lives are fulfilling. There is no parent more vulnerable to the excesses of over  parenting than an unhappy parent. One of the most important things we do for our children is to present them with a version of adult life that is appealing and worth striving for.
 Parenting has become more challenging in today’s face-paced, technological society. A few essential skills for parents to remember are as follows: <br>
 <ol>
     <li>create a loving space your child can always return to when life gets tough and chaotic. </li><br>
     <li>consider small ways to connect with your child each day to create long-lasting memories.</li><br>
 <li>  Positive role models can be extremely important throughout a child’s life; specially for relationships </li><br>
<li> being busy all the time can be counterproductive. </li><br>
<li>advocate and serve together with your child. Expose your child to a variety of types of situations and people in our world. Talk to your child about what they notice, listen to their observations, and answer their questions. Then, together take action and serve for the betterment of others within your community and beyond. </li><br>
</ol>

						   <h4> Value Education </h4>
						   <span>Posted by <a href="#" class="trans3s p-color">Tarang Gaur</a> at </span>
						   <p> Values are essential for positive human behaviour. Education from time immemorial has focused on values. Values form the core of educational goals and objectives. Education is inherently values oriented and must develop in learners caring, co-operation and respect for others. In addition to equipping them with life skills and attitudes, it must prepare them to lead a full life. A value is one of the many alternatives that a person chooses and acts upon because it increases human development. Values constitute that which is accepted by the group, community or society. Hence, all the aspects are important and linked to each other. Value means primarily to prize, to esteem, to appraise, to estimate, it means the act of cherishing something, holding it dear and also the act of passing judgment upon the nature and amounts of values as compared with something else. Today there is deterioration of values in the society. The values have been neglected not only at the social level but at the national level also. There are several factors with the modern higher education which are making people literate or educated undoubtedly but on the other hand responsible for forgetting the basics or values of a good human being or a responsible citizen of the society. In the existing educational system lays greater emphasis on individualism, competition, verbal fluency or linguistic ability and mere acquisition of information is given, this is just not sufficient and great emphasis will have to be given on the value education. Since it is the time to coherence with broadly acceptable national cultural identity where social values and development can be naturally reinforcing. The cultural values need to be identified for standard curricula all over the country. The value education should be imparted compulsorily up to the high school level. Evaluation of value education should be routine one and it should be based upon the daily observations of student by teachers and peers and should be monitored by administrator properly and also by the parents. 
In simple words, Values education" refers to the education of children about the values which are set forth as being a solid standard for living one's life by. Value are deeper than feelings. Value education is rooted in Indian philosophy and culture and entrenched in every tradition of Indian culture. Educational institutions play a significant role in the promotion of value. In the Vedic period, In Ashram education, the Guru insists his sishya to follow certain values throughout his life.
Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Justice, Liberty Equality, Fraternity, Dignity of the individuals and integrity of the nation are the ideal conditions in the Constitution. Our values in life must draw their inspiration from these ideals. Special emphasis must be on the following values in the formation of character of the students:
<ol>
    <li>Efficiency</li>
    <li>Good Temper</li>
    <li>Cooperation</li>
    <li>Integrity</li>
    <li>Discipline</li>
    <li>Requirement for Value Education</li>
</ol>
Moral awareness should be endorsed to orient the progress in science & technology towards the welfare of mankind.
Common values should be re-discovered to unite human beings with the general decline of traditional values.
Teachers pass values to the students both consciously and unconsciously through their conduct in and out of class rooms. Therefore the need for a consciously planned value education program is obvious to establish a formal learning.
The students might face more complicated decision making situations about issues involving values. They should be helped in developing the ability to make proper choices in such situations through value education.
Increase in Juvenile delinquency is a crisis to youth who under goes the process of personal growth. In such situation value education assumes a special significance.
Value Education awakens curiosity, development of proper interests, attitudes, values and capacity to think and judge about oneself.
Value Education helps in Promoting Social and Natural Integration.
Aims and Objectives of Value Education
<ol>
  <li>Value education should aim at the development of values of the following type.</li>
  <li>Scientific temper of mind.</li>
  <li>Large heartedness.</li>
  <li>Co-operation.</li>
   <li>Tolerance</li>
   <li>Respect for the culture of other groups.</li>
     <li>Implementation of Value Education </li>
</ol>
Value education should involve both knowledge and action. It should be given each and every student and an individual of the society, because they help become the future generation of our country. Values oriented education should be regarded essentially as an education for becoming and self-exceeding. Today, we need such a system of education which may turn out the raw material into finished product which is that of a complete man who is a practitioner of higher human values and whose life is devoted to the service of mankind. The complexity of modern life with its focus being materialism and affluence has resulted on the erosion if higher values. The society has become narrow minded and selfish. Each member is concerned with his own good. The impact of this is that the corruption, rivalry, jealousy etc. To evacuate these evils the value oriented education is essential. 

Ways for Promoting Value Education 
<ul>

<li>The value orientation should become the main focus of our educational system. In providing education for values whole of the society should be involved. The emphasis should be on moral development of the students. </li>

<li>Value education cannot be provided through proper text book but with inspiration and initiative of the teachers, the can be taught in a proper way. There are some ways for providing value education for the students.</li>
</ul>
 These are as follows – 
<ul>
<li>Social and ethical values, examples from day-to-day situations, extracts from sayings of great even, incidents and problems which develops values judgments among the pupils, poems, religious stories etc. can be taught to the students. </li>

<li>In school yoga and other religious activities like – pray to god, social service etc. can be taught to the students in the classrooms. Group activities like cleaning the school camps, visiting slums, service campus, visits to hospitals, visits to place of worship of different faiths should form part of content in value education.</li>
</ul><br>

<h5>Conclusion </h5>
<br>
Science and technology which is a great triumph for human kinds in this new era which makes human's life better and easier. Due to the gift of technologies, the world is connected and seems as one small city or village. People of this globe more voracious on material comfort which makes people's life more competitive. Hence, material wealth has become major indicator for measuring the success in every society instead of value based person. However, human's civilization fundamentally depends upon the cultivation of values, those values which shape human's lives and craft real human. Indeed, it is observed everywhere the values are degrading constantly which results increasing of inhuman activities. Thus; there is a great need for imparting value based education in each stage of education. Although education is an agent of change and the expected process of inculcating values to equip the learners for their successful life with the cherished values and contribute to ideal and healthy society.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model setence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
